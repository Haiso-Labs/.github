**Who are we?**

We are a team committed to building the foundations that help the entire ecosystem grow. We focus on the overlooked areas that quietly shape performance, scalability, and the developer experience—because strong ecosystems are built on strong infrastructure.

We spend our time identifying the systems, tools, and optimizations that unlock growth for everyone else. When something is slowing teams down, limiting experimentation, or blocking new categories of innovation, we step in and turn it into an opportunity. Our work ranges from improving developer workflows to refining protocol behaviors, advancing new data techniques, and exploring fresh architectural patterns.

Our approach is simple: build what accelerates progress. We look for what is needed to be done and we ship it fast.
